## üòé Usage

### üõ† Setup

#### (Optional) Spicetify Setup
- With Spicetify, we can directly get playback information from desktop app, which provides much more precise information.
- Installation of Spicetify: [Refer to this.](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/)
- Add [this modified webnowplaying extension](webnowplaying.js) to the extension folder and then update and apply the config. [Refer to this.](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions)
- Known Issue: Pause and Re-start when a new track starts (so the nowplaying information is correct)
    - A slightly noticeable pause after ~1s into the track
    
#### LyricBar Setup

- Directly unzip from release.zip, or
- Run with python
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    (proxy setting)
    python ./main.py
    ```

#### (Optional) Get Target App ID
- If you are not using Spotify, you need to run [get_target_id.py](./get_target_id.py) or the corresponding .exe file in release zip to get the id of the app you would like to track. Then set the 'Tracking App' key in [Global Settings](settings.yaml).

    ```
    python ./get_target_id.py
    ```

#### (Optional) Setup STT
- If you want to use STT mode:
    - You need to download model from [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) then extract, and update the "Model Path" key in [Global Settings](settings.yaml).
    - You need to setup system audio loopback. One solution is [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). Install then update the "Tracking Input" key in [Global Settings](settings.yaml) with the name of your input (check that in Control Panel). (the installation takes a while and the window may freeze just wait patiently!)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- [Global Settings](settings.yaml)
- [Themes](themes/)

### üéÆ Control

| Key | Function |
|:---:|:--------:|
| **Ctrl + Mouse Hover** | Keep the lyrics widget open |
| Mouse Left Button | Copy current line |
| Mouse Right Button | Switch to next lyrics provider |
| Shift + Mouse Right Button | Switch between STT mode and lyrics mode |
| Mouse Middle Button | Reset track lyrics offset |
| Shift + Mouse Middle Button | Clear lyrics |
| Scroll Up/Down | Adjust track lyrics offset |
| Shift + Scroll Up/Down | Adjust global lyrics offset |

- It should be noted that the song progress from WRT may **be within 0-1 second error**, so you probably need to adjust global offset every run. If this bothers you then maybe you should use **Spicetify** as playing information provider, or switch to other spotify-API-based desktop lyrics apps.
