## üòé Usage

### üõ† Setup

#### (Optional) Spicetify Setup
- With Spicetify, we can directly get playback information from desktop app, which provides much more precise information.
- Installation of Spicetify: [Refer to this.](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/)
- Add [this modified webnowplaying extension](webnowplaying.js) to the extension folder and then update and apply the config. [Refer to this.](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions)

#### LyricBar Setup

- Directly unzip from release.zip, or
- Run with python
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    (proxy setting)
    python ./main.py
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- [Global Settings](settings.yaml)
- [Themes](themes/)

### üéÆ Control

| Key | Function |
|:---:|:--------:|
| **Ctrl + Mouse Hover** | Keep the lyrics widget open |
| Mouse Left Button | Copy current line |
| Mouse Right Button | Switch to next lyrics provider |
| Mouse Middle Button | Reset track lyrics offset |
| Shift + Mouse Middle Button | Clear lyrics |
| Scroll Up/Down | Adjust track lyrics offset |
| Shift + Scroll Up/Down | Adjust global lyrics offset |

- It should be noted that the song progress from WRT may **be within 0-1 second error**, so you probably need to adjust global offset every run. If this bothers you then maybe you should use **Spicetify** as playing information provider, or switch to other spotify-API-based desktop lyrics apps.
